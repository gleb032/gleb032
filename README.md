### Hi there 👋

✨ My name is Gleb as you can see by my nickname. I am a junior/intern iOS developer.

🎓 I am a third-year undergraduate student of the NRU MPEI majoring in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.

🧑‍💻 At the moment I am interning in the [Yandex Browser](https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/yandex-browser/id483693909?l=en) team, as well as constantly learning something new in iOS development and other areas :)

Open to new acquaintances and would be happy to work on interesting projects 🙂
